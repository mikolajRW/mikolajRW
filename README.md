- 👋 Hi, I’m Mikołaj 
- 👀 I’m interested in ETL processes and working with a wide range of databases, both NoSQL and SQL.
- I have a strong proficiency in MySQL and enjoy exploring how data analysis can influence real-world societal outcomes.
- The potential for data to drive meaningful change in various industries is what captivates me the most
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge of NoSQL databases, including technologies like Redis and Hadoop/Hive. I am taking my first steps in the Java framework Spring Boot. 
- 💞️ My long-term goal is to apply my technical knowledge to positively impact the bussines or political landscape, especially in areas such as data-driven decision-making and innovation.
